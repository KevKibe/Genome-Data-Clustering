# Genome-Data-Clustering<br>
# Background<br>
DNA can be represented as a text sequence, with an alphabet that only has four letters - A (Adenosine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine) and T (Thymine). The diversity of living organisms and their complex properties is hidden in their genomic sequences. One of the most exciting problems in modern science is to understand the organization of living matter by reading genomic sequences.<br>

One distinctive message in a genomic sequence is a piece of text, called a gene. Genes can be oriented in the sequence in either the forward or backward directions. In the highest organisms (humans, for example), the notion of a gene is more complex.<br>

# Task<br>
To look at the file and ensure that the text uses the alphabet of four letters (A, C, G and T), and that these letters are used without spaces.<br>

To perform PCA to identify the internal structure of the data.<br>

To apply Clustering techniques to the dataset.<br>
